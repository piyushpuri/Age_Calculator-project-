Hi Eduonix Team,

I am Piyush Puri, share you the thoughts which i had in my mind when i had creating this python program,

Very first i had created a function called [Age_Calculator()] and then i had to take the input from the user and store this input in some variable, and then i need to apply all the (if,elif or else) statements to check how the user want to check their age in which time units. So, i simply implement all these statements and this is how my program works. I also set the condition if user want to try again then they need to simply type yes to again run the same program.
This program work fantastically.

Thank You SO Much Eduonix Team.

Regards
